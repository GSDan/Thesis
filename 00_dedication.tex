% ******************************* Thesis Dedidcation ********************************

\begin{dedication} 

This thesis would not have been possible without my many colleagues who contributed towards facilitating workshops, testing apps, and writing papers. Special thanks go to my supervisor, Dr Ahmed Kharrufa: who gave consistently valuable feedback throughout the research and writing processes, and was my partner in crime in spending too much money on speakers and camera gear. Particular thanks also go to the remaining co-authors on the papers which came out of this thesis: Dr Clara Crivellaro, Dr Kyle Montague, Dr Pradthana Jarusriboonchai, and Professor Patrick Olivier; all of whom have their mucky fingerprints in this document.

To the staff and students of Open Lab, past and present: thanks for putting up with me, and creating such a weird, welcoming and unforgettable workplace. Particular love goes to the education group (Ahmed, Megan, the Colins, Dan, Rebecca, Raghda, Serdar, Vidya, Anna), my placement pals (Jay, Rosie, Carlos), the Blighttown Brigade (James, Jazz, Dan, Kellie), and all of my Cohort 2 family.

I would also like to thank my collaborators and friends in both the Heritage Forum and in schools across the North of England, whose trust, patience and imagination made OurPlace possible.

Finally, many thanks and love go to my family, who provide endless support and encouragement, and to my loving partner Connie, who (despite presumably being sick of me) I've somehow corrupted into entering a career as a developer and managed to drag across the world with me.
