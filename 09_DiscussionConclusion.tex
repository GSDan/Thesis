\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}

This research has taken place against a backdrop of political and financial uncertainty for much of the UK. The two main demographics that the project engaged with---volunteer-driven heritage preservation groups, and teachers within the formal education system---have both been impacted in recent years by pressures imposed by top-down institutional policy, and funding cuts made to cope with austerity measures. In response, these groups have started to look towards more sustainable methods of utilising existing resources and novel methods of engagement. Mobile technologies clearly have a potential role in this space: their growing ubiquity in society, as well as the popularity of location-aware applications such as \textit{Pok\'emon Go}, have meant that a large number of community groups we talked to were actively seeking to be represented through mobile applications. Similarly, the utilisation of mobile technologies in schools has gained popularity---both for data collection on school trips, and in the classroom for research and content creation.

This project has aimed to explore this context as a design space for mobile learning technologies which harness places---and the communities that care for them---as resources for both learning within the formal education system, and informal knowledge sharing within wider communities. Furthermore, I wanted to explore how such technologies could be used by place stakeholders to further their groups' interests and agendas, and how such mediums could be used to share their outlooks and values with new audiences.

With these contexts and aims as a backdrop, this chapter will discuss the findings that have been identified during the previously discussed studies. These discussions will pertain to how mobile learning technologies can be configured to support place-making and recommendations as to how researchers and designers can better utilise the infrastructures of place as resources for civic mobile learning. I also discuss some of the study's limitations, before concluding by responding to the research questions laid out at the project's inception.


\section{Supporting Place-Making with Mobile Learning Technologies}

Our relationships to place are molded by the experiences and familiarity we have with space. As Tuan posited: `\textit{What begins as undifferentiated space becomes place as we get to know it better and endow it with value}' \citep{Tuan1978}. Similarly, Relph argues that the process of building a relationship with space involves encountering and having experiences with it \citep{Relph1976}. Furthermore, he notes that the majority of the experiences that people had with the landscapes around them in the 1970s were mediated by machines---he noted that while it is easy to view this as a factor which acted as a barrier separating people from authentically experiencing place, technologies such as cars opened up new opportunities for people to experience spaces that had not previously been accessible to them. Today, it's pretty clear that mobile technologies play the same role---simultaneously erecting barriers to distract people from authentic experiences in place, and opening up new opportunities to encounter places which would otherwise be too remote or abstract to be easily accessible. While we must be aware and wary of the former, the latter presents new and exciting opportunities for using technology to support place-making processes. For, unlike the automobile, digital technologies allow users to traverse more than just physical distances: they can be configured to support encountering different interpretations of place, which may not have been previously accessible (or visible) regardless of physical proximity.

As, according to Tuan, our interpretations of place are based upon our experiences with it, people who inhabit the same physical space may, due to differing past experiences, associate the space with different meanings and values. Giving stakeholders opportunities to share these experiences with others can make their understanding of the space as a place less abstract, and help them understand what makes a place special. I argue that these studies have demonstrated that mobile learning technologies such as OurPlace can be used as platforms to offer these opportunities.  These studies showed how the creation of mobile learning activities can give opportunities for highlighting and sharing what Kudryavtsev labelled \textit{place attachment} and \textit{place meaning} \citep{Kudryavtsev2012}. Place attachment---the degree to how much someone values or identifies with a place, from it fulfilling their needs or defining them as an individual---was demonstrated through the use of the app by park volunteers in Chapter \ref{chap:Community} to highlight their group's efforts and attempt to recruit new members. Meanwhile, place meaning---the meanings that individuals ascribe to settings that they are familiar with, reflecting their environment, social interactions, culture, politics, economics and history---was seen through the use of the app to discuss notable figures in local history in Chapter \ref{chap:Teachers}, or by the Showchildren in Chapter \ref{chap:student-created} to introduce their ways of life). This is not unique to OurPlace: another example is Balestrini's CrowdMemo project, during which a mobile technology acted as a platform for community storytelling \citep{Balestrini2014}.

This use of mobile technologies for highlighting place attachment and meaning could be particularly useful when used in places which are `under appreciated'. For example, during the ParkLearn workshop covered in Chapter \ref{chap:Community}, volunteers referred to the value they held in the imperfections (such as generations old graffiti) of the places they cared for. In some cases, making these safe or suitable for physical public access could sanitise them, eradicating what made the places special to the stakeholders in the first place. In these instances, mobile learning technologies offer a potential solution: allowing people to remotely experience place they cannot physically access, supporting the building of vicarious insideness and support for preservation. While such place-making interactions can also be supported by non-mobile technologies (for example, the use of Google Earth VR by Jeff Gerstmann discussed in Section \ref{sec:TechMediator}), the use of mobile learning technologies can also support the ability for remote place `visitors' to respond to activities through the use of their own space/place context (e.g. comparing and contrasting the learner's lived experiences with the place they are remotely encountering). More subversively, the grassroots nature of OurPlace's Activity creation process could also allow unofficial support for people entering these areas unsanctioned (something which the participants reported happened anyway). The ability to remotely open up these places without the need to sanitise their value could help counter Relph's concerns regarding `placelessness': `\textit{the casual eradication of distinctive places and the making of standardised landscapes that results from an insensitivity to the significance of place}' \citep{Relph1976}.

A key advantage of mobile learning technologies is that they allow for users to engage in authentic learning contexts---in both the humanist geographer sense that they can provide `genuine experiences' through unmediated access to place's social qualities and constructs \citep{Relph1976}, and also in the learning sciences sense, where Situated Learning Theory posits that legitimate peripheral participation in communities of practice \citep{lave1991situated}. Through supporting communities of practice in creating and sharing learning resources, mobile learning technologies make it easier for newcomers to engage in peripheral participation with those communities. Emphasising this link between the learning resources and the individuals/communities which create them further encourages the place-making process: learners are exposed to others' place attachment and place meaning, while also forging their own experiences in place via the technology medium. This exposure to communities of practice may not be immediately obvious to the learner---for example, the rangers and volunteers in Chapter \ref{chap:DesignSpace} aimed to nurture an appreciation of their place within the schoolchildren, rather than recruit them as volunteers. Sometimes this may be more explicit, as in the case of the `Talking Statue' project, where the OurPlace Activity included Information Tasks which described the volunteer group's work and how the user could get involved. However, even this was obscured behind the Activity's primary goal of delivering historical information about the park's heritage.

The combination of mobile hardware, wireless networking and easily configurable software enables these communities of practice to design and create novel interactions for use by others within an authentic learning environment. In this regard, OurPlace Activities could be classed within the scope of `cross-media interaction', as posited by Giaccardi et al \citep{Giaccardi2008}. They argue that the use of multiple forms of media and technology can create new forms of socio-technical infrastructure, allowing place-making through new cultural experiences and the exploration of people's relationship with place. Giaccardi et al. also argue the importance of making heritage a `living practice' through repeated interactions over time, where people are given `\textit{active and supportive roles, [engaging] them in connecting to each others’ experiences, considering each other’s interpretations, and building insights that may lead to new meanings and relationships.}' The use of OurPlace within schools shows how this might be put into practice, with the local heritage around each school acting as each class's focus for both research and creativity. The nature of digital content and school cohort systems also encourages this to be an ongoing, living practice: where each class experiences and builds upon the previous class's local heritage research. As with Crivellaro's walking trail \citep{Crivellaro2016}, the mobile nature of the technology also supports a large amount of this process to happen through genuine engagement with the environment, with many of the app's Task Types encouraging learners to pause and reflect in-situ.

As McCarthy and Wright argue, mobile phones and tablets are intrinsically personal devices which are particularly well suited to engaging people in making intimate observations and reflections---allowing for private encounters in public space, and `\textit{blurring the traditional boundaries between public and private, intimate and extraneous}' \citep{McCarthy2005}.

the importance of the individual stakeholder sharing their point of view - Relph argues that this could partly be due to how space is perceived at a larger scale–he posits that the identity of a place becomes less authentic the more people share that identity.  He gives the example:‘a city presents a different image to those living in its mansions and those living in its slums’. The ‘public’ identity of the city would involve a consensus understanding of its image, representing the outlooks of it by all communities. The result is something superficial and contrived, likely representing neither of these communities authentically.

McCarthy and Wright suggest that for technologies to help people feel ‘in place’, they should engage at a personal level, rather than treat them as an anonymous entity

dangers of place being misrepresented by those who are invested in its success or blind to its flaws -  Relph also warns against the dangers of ‘museumisation’—the simplification and sanitisation of history to create a more palatable ideal.  He argues that by highlighting only the best bits of local history, we run the risk of creating a ‘Disneyfied’,inauthentic image of place.
this is best combated by opening up the ability to create and share to all stakeholders

however, crivellaro study - the residents wanted to posit a realistic view which maintained a sense of optimism and used the negative associations they had with their homes more constructively

\section{Recommendations for Utilising Public Places as Infrastructure for Civic Mobile Learning}

\subsection{Genuine and Meaningful Engagement}

Relph asserts that by undervaluing places’ distinctive characteristics, being overly concerned with efficiency and accepting environments which are interchangeable to the point of anonymity, we run the risk of normalising‘inauthentic’experiences of place.

\subsection{Support Stakeholder Requirements}

Previous work by Chatting et al. \citep{Chatting2017} has considered how an individual’s agency (argued to be a component of empowerment \citep{Ibrahim2007}) can be supported in the new Internet of Things world by applying lessons learned from the DIY movement to new, digital technologies. We believe that parallels can be drawn to this with our teachers and park volunteers: they were able to fulfil their goal through technology, (mostly) independent of the usual top-down institutional restrictions which would have affected their creative control and output (DG1). Uphoff argues that an empowerment process needs to provide access to ‘power resources’—the assets which create possibilities for achieving objectives [38]. For our teachers and volunteers, Activity authorship was a power resource: it allowed them to create their own content as they saw fit and release it in their own timeframe, with minimal top-down assistance. We suggest that future m-learning designs should consider how they can empower the user through content ownership. In ParkLearn, this was achieved by granting more creative control to users and elevating them from consumers to producers of educational content.

\subsection{Providing Sustainable Solutions}
working with and within stakeholder groups
balestrini note that a sense of ownership of the project wouldnot have been enough to sustain engagement with it—they argue that this was achieved byproviding value to all of the involved stakeholders (i.e. valuing the elderly participants’ lifeexperiences, giving the young students new technology skills, supporting the teachers inrunning an innovative educational project)
 facilitating a range of face-to-face social encounters can lead to discussion andongoing engagement

\section{Limitations}

education
A limitation of this research is that they were only loosely tied into each school curriculum, and didn't assess learning outcomes. We hope that future engagements can offer deeper integration into existing curricula and feature formal assessments, supporting further insights into how PBML can fit into wider school systems. 

place stakeholders
To better understand these factors, it’s likely that we as researchers will have to growrelationships with a place over time through direct habitation, or at least involve existingstakeholders as participants who have ongoing relationships with it. However, this becomesboth more interesting and potentially problematic when accounting for Tuan’s arguments ofthe influence of personal experience–because a person’s place attachment is formed basedupon individual experience, researchers should be aware that their perceptions of place may not align with others’, running the risk of inappropriate design decisions if not handled with care

star vs workshop participants
Star recalls that few participants in one of her projects utilisedthe final system that her team designed, despite the researchers following the principlesof participatory design throughout the process.  They identified that this was not becauseof usability issues with the interface, but rather how their design was a poor fit with theinfrastructures the participants had to work with.
