\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}

This research has taken place against a backdrop of political and financial uncertainty for much of the UK. The two main demographics that the project engaged with---volunteer-driven heritage preservation groups, and teachers within the formal education system---have both been impacted in recent years by pressures imposed by top-down institutional policy, and funding cuts made to cope with austerity measures. In response, these groups have started to look towards more sustainable methods of utilising existing resources and novel methods of engagement. Mobile technologies clearly have a potential role in this space: their growing ubiquity in society, as well as the popularity of location-aware applications such as \textit{Pok\'emon Go}, have meant that a large number of community groups we talked to were actively seeking to be represented through mobile applications. Similarly, the utilisation of mobile technologies in schools has gained popularity---both for data collection on school trips, and in the classroom for research and content creation.

This project has aimed to explore this context as a design space for mobile learning technologies which harness places---and the communities that care for them---as resources for both learning within the formal education system, and informal knowledge sharing within wider communities. Furthermore, I wanted to explore how such technologies could be used by place stakeholders to further their groups' interests and agendas, and how such mediums could be used to share their outlooks and values with new audiences.

With these contexts and aims as a backdrop, this chapter will discuss the findings that have been identified during the previously discussed studies. These discussions will pertain to how mobile learning technologies can be configured to support place-making and recommendations as to how researchers and designers can better utilise the infrastructures of place as resources for civic mobile learning. I also discuss some of the study's limitations, before concluding by responding to the research questions laid out at the project's inception.


\section{Supporting Place-Making with Civic Mobile Learning Technologies}

Our relationships to place are molded by the experiences and familiarity we have with space. As Tuan posited: `\textit{What begins as undifferentiated space becomes place as we get to know it better and endow it with value}' \citep{Tuan1978}. Similarly, Relph argues that the process of building a relationship with space involves encountering and having experiences with it \citep{Relph1976}. Furthermore, he notes that the majority of the experiences that people had with the landscapes around them in the 1970s were mediated by machines---he noted that while it is easy to view this as a factor which acted as a barrier separating people from authentically experiencing place, technologies such as cars opened up new opportunities for people to experience spaces that had not previously been accessible to them. Today, it's pretty clear that mobile technologies play the same role---simultaneously erecting barriers to distract people from authentic experiences in place, and opening up new opportunities to encounter places which would otherwise be too remote or abstract to be easily accessible. While we must be aware and wary of the former, the latter presents new and exciting opportunities for using technology to support place-making processes. For, unlike the automobile, digital technologies allow users to traverse more than just physical distances: they can be configured to support encountering different interpretations of place, which may not have been previously accessible (or visible) regardless of physical proximity.

Thus, place is a social, spatio-temporal value, where space and time go together in shaping a person’s interpretations. People who inhabit the same physical space may, due to differing past experiences, associate the space with different meanings and values.
 
sharing these experiences with newcomers can make their understanding of the space as a place less abstract, and help them understand what makes a place special. 

volunteers in heritage workshop - However, Relph claims that this is increasingly being overshadowed in our modern era by an attitude he refers to as‘placelessness’:‘the casual eradication of distinctive places and the making of standardised landscapes that results from an insensitivity to the significance of place’

the creation of mobile learning activities can give opportunities for highlighting and sharing place attachment (the degree to how much someone values or identifies with a place, from it from fulfilling their needs or defining them as an individual) and place meaning (the meanings that individuals ascribe to settings that they are familiar with, reflecting their environment, social interactions, culture,politics, economics and history) (as seen in CrowdMemo)

- place-making occurs through experiencing place over time - mobile learning technologies offer new opportunities to experience place
    -novel interactions can be enabled between local communities and their places of heritage within authentic environmental settings. - (cross-media interaction) Giaccardi
    - in authentic learning contexts (encouraging a genuine engagement with the environment andstimulated pause and reflection - crivellaro), or
    - remotely, through vicarious insideness (comparison to Google Earth VR, but possibility for responding with own spatial context)
    - Invitation from a stakeholder to join `inside' a place by becoming more familiar with it
    - mobile devices are intrinsically personal - McCarthy and Wright 
    - allow for explorations of private interpretations or subversions of place within public space (RIOT!1831, Google Earth, Ged plaques)


the importance of the individual stakeholder sharing their point of view - Relph argues that this could partly be due to how space is perceived at a larger scale–he posits that the identity of a place becomes less authentic the more people share that identity.  He gives the example:‘a city presents a different image to those living in its mansions and those living in its slums’. The ‘public’ identity of the city would involve a consensus understanding of its image, representing the outlooks of it by all communities. The result is something superficial and contrived, likely representing neither of these communities authentically.

McCarthy and Wright suggest that for technologies to help people feel ‘in place’, they should engage at a personal level, rather than treat them as an anonymous entity

supports heritage becoming a living practice (giving people active andsupportive roles, [engaging] them in connecting to each others’ experiences, considering eachother’s interpretations, and building insights that may lead to new meanings and relationships... express their perceptions, interpretations and expectations about the heritage - Giaccardi)

crivellaro - (anticipatory archaeology’)

dangers of place being misrepresented by those who are invested in its success or blind to its flaws -  Relph also warns against the dangers of ‘museumisation’—the simplification and sanitisation of history to create a more palatable ideal.  He argues that by highlighting only the best bits of local history, we run the risk of creating a ‘Disneyfied’,inauthentic image of place.
this is best combated by opening up the ability to create and share to all stakeholders

however, crivellaro study - the residents wanted to posit a realistic view which maintained a sense of optimism and used the negative associations they had with their homes more constructively

\section{Recommendations for Utilising Public Places as Infrastructure for Civic Mobile Learning}

\subsection{Genuine and Meaningful Engagement}

Relph asserts that by undervaluing places’ distinctive characteristics, being overly concerned with efficiency and accepting environments which are interchangeable to the point of anonymity, we run the risk of normalising‘inauthentic’experiences of place.

\subsection{Support Stakeholder Requirements}

Previous work by Chatting et al. \citep{Chatting2017} has considered how an individual’s agency (argued to be a component of empowerment \citep{Ibrahim2007}) can be supported in the new Internet of Things world by applying lessons learned from the DIY movement to new, digital technologies. We believe that parallels can be drawn to this with our teachers and park volunteers: they were able to fulfil their goal through technology, (mostly) independent of the usual top-down institutional restrictions which would have affected their creative control and output (DG1). Uphoff argues that an empowerment process needs to provide access to ‘power resources’—the assets which create possibilities for achieving objectives [38]. For our teachers and volunteers, Activity authorship was a power resource: it allowed them to create their own content as they saw fit and release it in their own timeframe, with minimal top-down assistance. We suggest that future m-learning designs should consider how they can empower the user through content ownership. In ParkLearn, this was achieved by granting more creative control to users and elevating them from consumers to producers of educational content.

\subsection{Providing Sustainable Solutions}
working with and within stakeholder groups
balestrini note that a sense of ownership of the project wouldnot have been enough to sustain engagement with it—they argue that this was achieved byproviding value to all of the involved stakeholders (i.e. valuing the elderly participants’ lifeexperiences, giving the young students new technology skills, supporting the teachers inrunning an innovative educational project)
 facilitating a range of face-to-face social encounters can lead to discussion andongoing engagement

\section{Limitations}

education
A limitation of this research is that they were only loosely tied into each school curriculum, and didn't assess learning outcomes. We hope that future engagements can offer deeper integration into existing curricula and feature formal assessments, supporting further insights into how PBML can fit into wider school systems. 

place stakeholders
To better understand these factors, it’s likely that we as researchers will have to growrelationships with a place over time through direct habitation, or at least involve existingstakeholders as participants who have ongoing relationships with it. However, this becomesboth more interesting and potentially problematic when accounting for Tuan’s arguments ofthe influence of personal experience–because a person’s place attachment is formed basedupon individual experience, researchers should be aware that their perceptions of place may not align with others’, running the risk of inappropriate design decisions if not handled with care

star vs workshop participants
Star recalls that few participants in one of her projects utilisedthe final system that her team designed, despite the researchers following the principlesof participatory design throughout the process.  They identified that this was not becauseof usability issues with the interface, but rather how their design was a poor fit with theinfrastructures the participants had to work with.
