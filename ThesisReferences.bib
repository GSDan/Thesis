abstract = {Mobile devices are increasingly being used by undergraduate students to access online information in the problem-based learning (PBL) process, initially in the self-directed phase, and more recently within face-to-face tutorials.  is qualitative study across three undergraduate health professional programs used semi-structured interviews to investigate facilitators' and students' perceptions of mobile device usage in PBL tutorials. Transcribed interviews were analyzed thematically, draw- ing on the principles of grounded theory. Implications for future practice were identi ed. Students perceived that mobile de- vices are useful and convenient for instant access to various sources of information, for note taking, and for visually sharing their research and ideas. Despite some facilitator concerns that mobile devices are potentially distracting in face-to-face PBL tutorials, students prioritized collaboration through brainstorming and sharing ideas with group members in face-to-face tutorials over searching online. Facilitators and students suggested practical guidelines for mobile device usage in tutorials to enhance critical thinking in PBL.},

@article{Massey2006,
abstract = {This paper describes efforts to develop a pedagogical environment that seeks to influence the learning experiences of students as mobile applications end users, developers, and decision makers. Specifically, via a collaborative effort involving industry sponsors, university technology services, and multiple academic units engaged in information technology education, a graduate-level course called Mobile Applications Development (MAD) was created. The core innovativeness of MAD lies in its delivery structure as a problem-based learning course - centered on emerging technologies like mobile technology - that brings together students with diverse backgrounds from different academic units across the campus. MAD culminates in an industry-sponsored competition, where student teams present their mobile solution to a panel of expert judges from industry and higher education. Via MAD and the associated competitions, students, faculty, and institutional partners can explore the opportunities and challenges associated with mobile technologies. This paper discusses how problem-based learning principles guided the design and implementation of MAD. A multiperspective assessment of the success of MAD is offered. Finally, key lessons learned and guidance to assist other educators are also offered. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

Through a process of iterative design in collaboration with library staff and children's writers we designed DoHS to support the potential for playful storytelling through interactions with books. A deployment of DoHS with two classes of 8 to 10 years olds as part of their regular library visits revealed insights related to how to balance the expectations of a child-at-play and the requirement to further develop their creative reading and writing skills.

abstract = {Over the next 10 years, we anticipate that personal, portable, wirelessly-networked technologies will become ubiquitous in the lives of learners - indeed, in many countries, this is already a reality. We see that ready-to-hand access creates the potential for a new phase in the evolution of technology-enhanced learning (TEL), characterized by "seamless learning spaces" and marked by continuity of the learning experience across different scenarios (or environments), and emerging from the availability of one device or more per student ("one-to-one"). One-to-one TEL has the potential to "cross the chasm" from early adopters conducting isolated design studies to adoption-based research and widespread implementation, with the help of research and evaluation that gives attention to the digital divide and other potentially negative consequences of pervasive computing. We describe technology-enhanced learning and the affordances of one-to-one computing and outline a research agenda, including the risks and challenges of reaching scale. We reflect upon how this compares with prior patterns of technology innovation and diffusion. We also introduce a community, called "G1:1," that brings together leaders of major research laboratories and one-to-one TEL projects. We share a vision of global research, inviting other research groups to collaborate in ongoing activities.},

We claim this analytical distinction is useful to understand the existence of a feedback effect between theory and political discourse. During the 1990s, the connection between social capital theory and neoliberalism has been transposed from academia to political discourse, thus contributing to popularise social capital within the public sphere. Over time, however, rising economic inequalities (exacerbated by the recent economic crises) have demonstrated that the neoliberal political agenda is incompatible with the aim to generate social capital. Focusing on the critical case of Britain, we argue that the rapid demise of the Big Society idea might signal a corresponding decline of social capital theory within academia.},

The group's work follows Papert's paradigm for learning research called Constructionism. Several of the chapters directly address the theoretical formulations of Constructionism, and others describe experimental studies which enrich and confirm different aspects of the idea. Thus this volume can be taken as the most extensive and definitive statement to date of this approach to media and education research and practice.

@book{Relph1976,
abstract = {Preface Relph starts the preface with the claim that many current-day analyses of the notion of environment are unsatisfactory, in that they are too theoretical, too distant, and do not include the lived world in their research. He wants to add to the discussion by providing a different way of looking at the notion of the environment, in particular by investigating the concept of place. Core to Relph's argumentation is the following quote: "...distinctive and diverse places are manifestations of a deeply felt involvement with those places by the people who live in them, and that for many such a profound attachment to place is as necessary and significant as a close relationship with other people. It is therefore disturbing that so much planning and remaking of landscapes proceeds apparently in ignorance of the importance of place, even though the protests of the expropriated and uprooted demonstrate this very importance." [p. ?? (no page numbering!)] Relph is worried about a phenomenon he calls "placelessness", defined as: "...the casual eradication of distinctive places and the making of standardised landscapes that results from an insensitivity to the significance of place." [p. ?? (no page numbering!)] When analyzing the notion of place Relph will use a phenomenological approach. Chapter 1: Place and the phenomenological basis of geography "To be human is to live in a world that is filled with significant places: to be human is to have and to know your place." [p. 1] In this first chapter Relph wants to investigate the ways in which place has been studied in geography. According to him most geographers take place to be something quite straightforward - a being a clear concept. But this is not the case. Relph quotes from the works of several geographers who did investigate this concept further to show that "place" has several denominations and layers of meaning. Firstly, he discusses the work of Lukermann (SEE ELSEWHERE IN THIS DATABASE). Lukermann distinguishes between 6 major components in the notion of place: (1) Location: "Location can be described in terms of internal characteristics (site) and external connectivity to other locations(situation); thus places have spatial extension and an inside and outside." [pg. 3] (2) Ensemble: each place is a unique combination of natural and cultural elements (3) Circulation: different places are connected to one another and are thus all part of a system of circulation (4) Localisation: "Places are localised - they are parts of larger areas and are focuses in a system of localisation." [pg. 3] (5) Emergent: places are never constant - they have a history and they are always changing in light of present developments (6) Meaning: places have specific meanings attached to them. Relph concludes: "Thus Lukermann understands places as complex integrations of nature and culture that have developed and are developing in particular locations, and which are linked by flows of people and goods to others places. A place is not just the 'where' of something; it is the location plus everything that occupies that location seen as an integrated and meaningful phenomenon." [pg. 3] Relph's criticism of Lukermann is that he doesn't clearly distinguish between the notion of "place" and that of for example "region", "area" and "location". Then Relph turns towards the work of May, who distinguishes four ways in which geographers use the word "place": (1) Place is the entire surface of the world (2) Place is a unit of space (e.g. a city, a village) (3) Place is a specific part of space containing some function (e.g. place of residence) (4) Place is location (i.e. coordinates in space) Relph notes that place cannot solely be studied as a formal geographical notion, but rather that the experience of place should always be included in any description of it. Then Relph summarizes his main argument in this book: "Of places are indeed a fundamental aspect of man's existence in the world, if they are sources of security and identity for individuals and for groups of people, then it is important that the means of experiencing, creating and maintaining significant places are not lost. Moreover there are many signs that these very means are disappearing and the 'placelessness' - the weakening of distinct and diverse experiences and identities of places - is now a dominant force. Such a trend marks a major shift in the geographical bases of existence from a deep association with places to rootlessness, a shift that, once recognised and clarified, may be judged undesirable and possibly countered." [p. 6] Chapter 2: Space and place In this chapter Relph wants to investigate the relationship between space and place. He starts the chapter with the claim that space is "...amorphous and intangible..." [p. 8], but that there is clearly always some form of association between space and place. Relph writes: "In general it seems that space provides the context for places but derives its meaning from particular places." [p. 8] The notion of "space" has different levels of meaning and these are discussed in detail by Relph: (1) Pragmatic or primitive space: "...is the space of instinctive behaviour and unselfconscious action in which we always act and move without reflection. This is and organic space that is rooted in things concrete and substantial and which involves not images or concepts of space and spatial relations." [p. 8] In primitive space the body plays a crucial role: it structures this form of space, by giving us a sense of what's up and down, in front and behind, etc. At this intuitive, instinctive level of space it is not really possible to distinguish between space and place. (2) Perceptual space: "...the egocentric space perceived and confronted by each individual. This is a space that has content and meaning, for it cannot be divorced from experiences and intentions. Perceptual space is a space of action centered on immediate needs and practices, and as such it has a clearly developed structure." [p. 10] Relph continues his description of perceptual space with a quote from Nitschke (quote from Norbert-Schulz 1971): "Perceptual space has a centre, which is perceiving man, and it therefore has an excellent system of directions which change with the movement of the human body; it is limited and in no sense neutral; in other words it is finite, heterogeneous and subjectively defined and perceived; distances and directions are fixed and relative to man." [p. 10]"...in perceptual space each individual groups the world around him as 'field of domination', and he singles out those elements which may serve as a means or an end for his use or enjoyment." [p. 10] Relph concludes that it is on the level of perceptual space that much of the experiential aspects of place that place - this is where meaning is formed. Another important element is that individuals are in their own place, which is part of the perceptual space, but at the same time realize in a fundamental way that everybody else also finds himself in his own place in the same way. (3) Existential or lived-space: "...is the inner structure of space as it appears to us in our concrete experience of the world as members of a cultural group [...]. It is intersubjective and hence amenable to all members of that group for they have all been socialised according to a common set of experiences, signs, and symbols [...]. The meanings of existential space are therefore those of a culture as experienced by an individual, rather than a summation of the meanings of individual perceptual spaces, though in many cases the two probably coincide. Furthermore existential space is not merely a passive space waiting to be experienced, but it is constantly being created and remade by human activities." [p. 12] Since the meaning of existential spaces arises within a culture, it may not be (easily) communicated to those outside that culture. One form of existential spaces are sacred spaces, but also in desecralized cultures such "centers of meaning" exist. Strangely enough these are termed "geographical space"... Relph notes that naming places is one fundamental way of assigning (cultural) meaning and significance to them. In relation to this topic Relph also discusses Heidegger's notion of dwelling. According to Heidegger building means dwelling and dwelling is fundamental for human existence. When we build/dwell we become aware of the foursome of earth, wind, gods and mortality. When looking at the ways in which people name and experience space there are two approaches, Relph says: (a) the vertical approach: first naming the continents, then the countries, then regions, then landscapes, urban levels, streets and finally homes. A beautiful picture of this model is printed on page 21. Relph writes: "...in general it seems that we do live in terms of a variety of levels though at any one moment our attention is focused on just one level: in voting our concern is with national space, but in finding the polling booth it is the spaces of the city and street that are important." [p. 20] (b) a horizontal approach: in horizontal levels of space on can distinguish between three parts: districts of significance (for a group of people with certain interests in a particular place), paths (that open up a place and connect it to other places) and places themselves (centers of significance, that are characterized by a sense of insideness). [p. 21] (4) Architectural space and planning space: in architectural and planning space an explicit attempt is made to create spaces. Architectural space and planned space are not exactly the same thing anymore, even though they were for a long time (up until the Renaissance). Planning space is the comprised space of buildings, squares, roads, parks etc. According to Relph the two have become uncoupled, since much building these days take place in isolation of the rest of the environment. Architects don't develop an entire area or c},

The development of platforms for community decision-making has been of growing interest to the HCI community, yet the ways technology might be woven into traditional consultation processes has been under-studied. We conducted fieldwork at consultation events where residents were invited to discuss and map assets related to their neighbourhoods to inform community decision-making. The fieldwork highlighted problems with equality, turn taking, the evidencing and elaborating on opinions by residents, and challenges related to capturing and documenting the events. We developed Community Conversational - a hybrid table-top game and digital capture and review platform - in response to these issues. Community Conversational was designed to provide a flexible structure to consultation events related to 'place', and support the production, capture and review of deliberative 'talk' to support decision-making. We study how the platform was used in two consultation events, and discuss the implications of capturing and evidencing local people's opinions for the accountability of decision-makers and community organisations.},

It was clear from the survey that most people had enjoyed Riot! however the interview data demonstrated that they had also experienced frustration even where overall enjoyment ratings were high.

The studies identify a number of usability problems such as inconsistency of interaction and non-reversibility that caused frustration. It also identifies problems with the script such as the presentation of linear narrative in a non-linear medium.

@article{Dewey1938,
abstract = {(summary from web) For John Dewey, education and democracy are intimately connected. According to Dewey good education should have both a societal purpose and purpose for the individual student. For Dewey, the long-term matters, but so does the short-term quality of an educational experience. Educators are responsible, therefore, for providing students with experiences that are immediately valuable and which better enable the students to contribute to society. Dewey polarizes two extremes in education - traditional and progressive education. The paradigm war still goes on - on the one hand, relatively structured, disciplined, ordered, didactic tradition education vs. relatively unstructured, free, student-directed progressive education. Dewey criticizes traditional education for lacking in holistic understanding of students and designing curricula overly focused on content rather than content and process which is judged by its contribution to the well-being of individuals and society. On the other hand, progressive education, he argues, is too reactionary and takes a free approach without really knowing how or why freedom can be most useful in education. Freedom for the sake of freedom is a weak philosophy of education. Dewey argues that we must move beyond this paradigm war, and to do that we need a theory of experience. Thus, Dewey argues that educators must first understand the nature of human experience. Dewey's theory is that experience arises from the interaction of two principles - continuity and interaction. Continuity is that each experience a person has will influence his/her future, for better or for worse. Interaction refers to the situational influence on one's experience. In other words, one's present experience is a function of the interaction between one's past experiences and the present situation. For example, my experience of a lesson, will depend on how the teacher arranges and facilitates the lesson, as well my past experience of similar lessons and teachers. It is important to understand that, for Dewey, no experience has pre-ordained value. Thus, what may be a rewarding experience for one person, could be a detrimental experience for another. The value of the experience is to be judged by the effect that experience has on the individual's present, their future, and the extent to which the individual is able to contribute to society. Dewey says that once we have a theory of experience, then as educators can set about progressively organizing our subject matter in a way that it takes accounts of students' past experiences, and then provides them with experiences which will help to open up, rather than shut down, a person's access to future growth experiences, thereby expanding the person's likely contribution to society. Dewey examines his theory of experience in light of practical educational problems, such as the debate between how much freedom vs. discipline to use. Dewey shows that his theory of experience (continuity and interaction) can be useful guides to help solving such issues. Throughout, there is a strong emphasis on the subjective quality of a student's experience and the necessity for the teacher of understanding the students' past experiences in order to effectively design a sequence of liberating educational experiences to allow the person to fulfil their potential as a member of society.},

abstract = {We present insights from an extended engagement and design intervention at an urban regeneration site in SE London. We describe the process of designing a walking trail and system for recording and playing back place-specific stories for those living and working on the housing estate, and show how this is set within a wider context of urban renewal, social/affordable housing and “community build- ing”. Like prior work, the research reveals the frictions that arise in participatory engagements with heterogeneous actors. Here we illustrate how material interventions can rearrange existing spatial configurations, making productive the plurality of accounts intrinsic in community life. Through this, we provide an orientation to HCI and design interventions that are concerned with civic engagement and participation in processes of making places.},

abstract = {This paper presents a description and evaluation of Myartspace, a service on mobile phones for inquiry-led learning that allows students to gather information during a school field trip which is automatically sent to a website where they can view, share and present it, back in the classroom or at home. The evaluation focused on three levels: a micro level, concerned with issues of usability; a meso level, which examined educational effectiveness in terms of learning breakthroughs and breakdowns; and a macro level, which looked at the impact of the new technology on school museum visits practice. Issues of implementing mobile learning across school and museum settings are identified and cross-level influences are discussed. The study showed that the service was effective in enabling students to gather information in a museum and this provided resources for effective construction and reflection in the classroom. Minor usability problems did not detract from the learning, however there are significant issues concerning how to structure the visit and on the viability of Myartspace as a regular service. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This article explores starting points for spatial citizenship education and discusses fields of competence needed for active spatial citizenship. The use of geoinformation (GI) systems at the secondary-school level has been considered mainly as preparation to join the geospatial workforce and as a support tool to encourage spatial thinking. While this approach definitely has benefits in arguing for a wider set of competencies acquired by GI-based learning, it has frequently been linked to instrumental knowledge, and misses out on the societal consequences of GI use. The concept of spatial citizenship attempts to address these shortcomings. Originating from the individual and collective appropriation of social space, it supports learners in acquiring competencies that will enable them to participate more actively in society through the critical use of GI. Spatial citizenship adds an explicitly spatial domain to citizenship education.},

abstract = {Over the past ten years mobile learning has grown from small-scale studies to large national and international projects, but it still lacks an evidence base of comparative studies and research into large-scale deployment. Existing systems can be described along a dimension of 'formality', ranging from mobile devices in fixed settings such as classrooms managed by a teacher, to highly mobile learning applications in informal learning, controlled by the learner. Recent research has investigated the concept of'seamless learning' with the aim of supporting a continuity of learning across contexts and devices, for example to connect learning in classrooms and on school museum visits. Factors influencing the success of mobile learning include: availability of technology, institutional support, connectivity, integration into everyday life, and ownership by the learners. Some challenges for the future include improving the usability of mobile learning technology, designing new forms of informal learning supported by personal mobile devices, and evaluating learning that occurs outdoors and across locations. Research and practice in mobile learning are still in their infancy. Over the past ten years the field has moved from small-scale research studies to some large national and international initiatives, such as the EC-funded MOBIlearn and m-Learning projects, a growing number of commercial services, and many institution-based projects. The evidence from research is mostly in the form of case studies that report the progress of a project, with accounts of their successes and difficulties drawn from observations by the researchers and interviews with participants. There have been a few attempts to carry out small-scale comparative evaluations of specific technologies, such as mind mapping tools on handheld computers, and a very small number of studies that have compared learning outcomes of classroom trials of handheld technology to traditional teaching. This paucity of quantitative and comparative data is entirely understandable given the rapid pace of developments in the technology and the time and resources needed to carry out a useful comparative evaluation. What is the value of running detailed educational evaluations of a prototype mobile learning system implemented on last-year's handheld technology? Thus, a critical reader of this paper may find that the evidence of what research has to say for practice is, at best, unreliable and outdated. However, taking a broader perspective, we find a fairly consistent pattern of reports about what works and what doesn't. We shall take an illuminative approach – attempting to shine a light on the emerging technologies and activities in mobile learning that appear, from a variety of evidence, to be supporting good practice in teaching and learning.

Locations relate to physical places or artifacts through QR codes and provide supportive information. The guidance takes place by identifying the user's location by scanning the QR codes and visualizing the appropriate information on the smartphone.

The development of TPACK by teachers is critical to effective teaching with technology. The paper begins with a brief introduction to the complex, ill- structured nature of teaching. The nature of technologies (both analog and digital) is considered, as well as how the inclusion of technology in pedagogy further complicates teaching. The TPACK framework for teacher knowledge is described in detail, as a complex interaction among three bodies of knowledge: Content, pedagogy, and technology. The interaction of these bodies of knowledge, both theoretically and in practice, produces the types of flexible knowledge needed to successfully integrate technology use into teaching. 60},

Our process comprised three stages: situated explorations and evidence gathering through digitally supported neighbourhood walks; issue mapping and peer-to-peer discussions using an online engagement platform; and faceto-face dialogue between children, residents, and the local authority through a 'Town Hall' event. We report insights gained through our engagement and show how our activities facilitated issue advocacy and the development of children's capacities, but also surfaced tensions around the agency of children in political processes.

WheelieMap captures and segments device video footage and GPS as evidence of the problematic space, which can then be shared with both other people with disabilities and the relevant authorities. We document the use of the WheelieMap prototype by both manual wheelchair users and planning experts through semi-structured interviews.

The study design is a quasi-experimental pre-post control group design. The sample was 62 11th-grade female students studying at a public school in Oman. The sample was divided into two groups: an experimental group (N = 34) which conducted five different environmental-based projects for two months and a control group (N = 28) which studied using the traditional methods. For the purpose of study, two instruments were designed: the Environmental Knowledge Test (EKT) and the Science Attitudes Survey (SAS). The results indicated that students' involvement in environmental projects had a statistically significant positive impact on their environmental knowledge and science attitudes. The experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in both instruments. The results also indicated that the projects that made the most impact were those that required students to produce enjoyable and unusual final products such as a documentary movie, a school-wide campaign, and school-wide environmental exhibit. This promising result is what distinguishes the current study: that PBL could be implemented with few resources, inside the school building and within the assigned time by the official teacher guide for the undertaken topics.

@article{Dourish2007,
abstract = {Although the current developments in ubiquitous and pervasive computing are driven largely by technological opportunities, they have radical implications not just for technology design but also for the ways in which we experience and interact with computation. In particular, the move of computation ‘off the desktop' and into the world, whether embedded in the environment around us or carried or worn on our bodies, suggests that computation is beginning to manifest itself in new ways as an aspect of the everyday environment. One particularly interesting issue in this transformation is the move from a concern with virtual spaces to a concern with physical ones. Basically, once computation moves off the desktop, computer science suddenly has to be concerned with where it might have gone. Whereas computer science and human – computer interaction have previously been concerned with disembodied cognition, they must now look more directly at embodied action and bodily encounters between people and technology. In this paper, we explore some of the implications of the development of ubiquitous computing for encounters with space. We look on space here as infrastructure—not just a technological infrastructure, but an infrastructure through which we experience the world. Drawing on studies of both the practical organization of space and the cultural organization of space, we begin to explore the ways in which ubiquitous computing may condition, and be conditioned by, the social organization of everyday space.},

@incollection{Noss2017,
abstract = {Seymour Papert launched the notion of constructionism in the mid-nineteen eighties. The central idea is that a powerful way for learners to build knowledge structures in their mind is to build with external representations, to construct physical or virtual entities that can be reflected on, edited and shared. In this chapter, we outline research that has addressed the ways that the constructionist approach seeks to develop knowledge structures in the mind alongside physical or virtual structures external to the mind, and as such is as much a theory of epistemology as of pedagogy. We show how constructionism involves choosing or designing representations, engaging artefacts and suitably oriented pedagogies that together can bring about fundamental change in how to learn and, if successful, will ultimately change what is learned. This brings us to the second theme of the chapter. One of the persistent challenges of realising the constructionist vision, is the tension between aiming to teach specific content of, say, mathematics or music, and at the same time affording the learner the experience of constructing, making, doing and problem solving. These two aims are, of course, not antithetical, but neither is it obvious how to align them for pedagogical purposes. We illustrate one solution that has evolved in the research literature: to design ``microworlds'', insulated and accessible islands of activity in which nuggets of relevant knowledge are encountered in a natural way---or at least, in which the chance of meeting the nuggets is designed to be as high as possible.},

In this paper we describe the design and development of ThoughtCloud and its evaluation through a series of deployments with two organisations. Using the system, organisations were able to pose questions about the activities that they provide and gather data in the form of ratings, video or audio messages. We conducted observations of ThoughtCloud in use, analysed feedback received, and conducted interviews with those who 'commissioned' feedback around the value of comments received about their organisation. Our findings highlight how simple, easily deployable digital systems can support new feedback processes within care organisations and provide opportunities for understanding the personal journeys and experiences of vulnerable individuals who use these care services.},

abstract = {HCI projects are increasingly evaluating technologies in the wild, which typically involves working with communities over extended periods, often with the goal of effecting sus- tainable change. However, there are few descriptions of projects that have been successful in the long-term. In this paper we investigate what factors are important for develop- ing long lasting community ICT interventions. We do this by analysing a successful action research project and provide five recommendations for facilitating sustained community engagement. CrowdMemo aimed to preserve local heritage in a town in rural Argentina and the project was set up so that it could be continued by the community once researchers had left. Participants created videos about personal memo- ries of the town and over 600 people attended the premiere where they were first screened. The impact has not just been short-term and there has been sustained engagement with the project by stakeholders in the town and wider region: the lo- cal school integrated digital storytelling into its curriculum; the approach has been adopted by two nearby towns; and the project has influenced regional government educational pol- icy.},

abstract = {This study presents a mobile exploration activity that guides elementary students to learn during a social science activity with digital support from mobile devices and wireless communications. The students are situated in both the real world and the virtual world to extend their learning experiences. The learning activities between the field and the digital system not only demonstrate the practices of mobile learning, which emphasizes learning that happens close to real life, but also provides digital learning content to facilitate students' field studies. To enhance the learning performance of the students, an inquiry-based mobile learning approach is employed to assist the students in constructing their own knowledge by taking cognitive load into consideration. To evaluate the effectiveness of the innovative approach, 33 fifth grade students were arranged to carry out investigations in the Peace Temple of southern Tainan with the inquiry-based mobile learning system. Through pre- and post- class questionnaires as well as observations and focus group interviews, descriptive quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed. The results show significant positive results in terms of the students' learning.},

This study examines if this initiative has been successful in affecting the civic engagement of young people who were exposed to the citizenship curriculum over the decade since it was introduced. It utilises a survey of 18–26 year olds conducted in 2011 and compares respondents who were exposed to the curriculum with those who were not in what is a natural experiment. The findings are that citizenship education had a positive impact on three key components of civic engagement: efficacy, political participation and political knowledge. This suggests that the reform is likely to help offset some of the trends in civic participation among young people which have shown a sharp decline in key activities like voting and voluntary activities over time. The study concludes by speculating on the likely effects of the coalition government's decision to drop citizenship education as a compulsory subject in the national curriculum in schools in 2014.}",
