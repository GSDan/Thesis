\subsection{Data Collection and Analysis}

A member of the research team was present during each of the app’s deployments, providing technical support as necessary and taking field notes. All interactions and data collection were approved by and conformed to the requirements of Newcastle University’s ethics committee. Audio recorded, semi-structured interviews were held with the adult participants throughout the study to understand their reasoning behind their Activity designs and their opinions of the technology. A thematic approach [4] to coding was performed across data from interviews, children’s creations within the app and observational notes. The resulting codes were reviewed and qualitatively analysed by the authors, and then grouped into candidate themes. These themes were summarised onto paper for discussion and validation before being finalised.
